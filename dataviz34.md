## Critique of the Original Table
During the critique of the original table 
## Initial Sketch:
My initial thought was to approach this with a column chart grouped by federal and state spending with a seperate color for "State Funding Used Instead of Federal" to bring extra attention to it. I grouped the 3 categories of federal spending in blue to be consistent with the color assocation of the U.S. federal government and red, white, and blue. I also grouped the 3 categories of state spending in orange to be consistent with Tennessee's color assocation. I used red in my sketch for "State Funding Used into of Federal" to call attention to it - like a red flag.

## Feedback on Sketch
For feedback, I spoke to:
Adult, early 60s
Student, mid 20s

Both people I interviewed suggested using shades of blue and orange to make the distinction between to the different categories within groups more clear. They also both agreed that "State Funding Used Instead of Federal" should be organge not red as the addition of the extra color made it intially unclear it was about state spending. Additionally, one person suggested using a bar chart because the horizontal orientation would make changes in the individual categories easier to compare over time.

## Final Visualization
During the group critique in-class, my two classmates agreed on the critique that the visualization did not have to include every column from the table to tell the main story. For the final verison, I removed the "Federal Award" column and "Federal Expenditure" column because it doesn't contribute to the overall narrative in a way that I felt necessary. Alone, the "Federal Surplus/Deficit" data gives the viewer the information to see Tennessee's trend in having a surplus of federal funding. I also removed the columns "State MOE" and "State Expenditure". Simiarly, I felt this information was relayed enough in the "State Expenditures Above MOE" data as that shows the specific trend of Tennessee spending additional state funds. By removing those four columns, the visualizatoin is simplified to the main components needed to understand the narrative. 
Lastly, I added a more descriptive title to this verison to make the visualization more intuitive.
