## Final Visualization
During the group critique in-class, my two classmates agreed on the critique that the visualization did not have to include every column from the table to tell the main story. For the final verison, I removed the "Federal Award" column and "Federal Expenditure" column because it doesn't contribute to the overall narrative in a way that I felt necessary. Alone, the "Federal Surplus/Deficit" data gives the viewer the information to see Tennessee's trend in having a surplus of federal funding. I also removed the columns "State MOE" and "State Expenditure". Simiarly, I felt this information was relayed enough in the "State Expenditures Above MOE" data as that shows the specific trend of Tennessee spending additional state funds. By removing those four columns, the visualizatoin is simplified to the main components needed to understand the narrative. 
Lastly, I added a more descriptive title to this verison to make the visualization more intuitive.
