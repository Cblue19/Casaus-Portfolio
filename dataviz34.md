# Assignments 3 & 4
For this assignment I chose to redesign the table featured in TANF memo #2 on the website for the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury. Here is the link to the memo: https://comptroller.tn.gov/content/dam/cot/orea/advanced-search/2020/tanf/TANFmemo_2-6-20.pdf and a link to the website for more information:https://comptroller.tn.gov/office-functions/research-and-education-accountability/publications/other-topics/content/tanf-memo-2020.html

I chose this table because I have used a image of this table in a presentation I made for a different course at Heinz last fall. Out of all of my slides in the presentation, this table took the longest to explain. The second time I gave the same presentation was to a group of undergraduate students, and I experienced the same confusion with the table. Althougth the intended audience (Tennessee's TANF Working Group) was expected to have extensive knowledge of TANF and mine did not, the confusion from my audience didn't seem to originate solely from differences in knowledge. Overall, I think this table has a lot of important information about trends in how Tennessee has spent TANF funds in the last decade, so I wanted to redesign the table to be more intuitive. 


## Critique of the Original Table
During the critique of the original table, I had two main takeaways. First, I thought the information could be better relayed as a bar or column chart. I didn't find the table to be the most effective way to communicate the story of the data.  To understand the story, the viewer has to take time to understand how the numbers are changing in each column because the trends in spending are not easily perceived in this format. Since the story here is about both spending trends over time and comparing state vs federal spending, this needs to be captured by the visualization. Second, the table lacked a title which would be very helpful in helping the audience piece together the story faster. 

## Initial Sketch:
My initial thought was to approach this with a column chart grouped by federal and state spending with a seperate color for "State Funding Used Instead of Federal" to bring extra attention to it. I wanted to group the information since the table utilized this format, and the main narrative focuses on a comparison of these two types of funding. Additionally, since the table contained 7 different columns, it  felt necessary to group the columns to simplify the information by grouping. I grouped the 3 categories of federal spending in blue to be consistent with the color assocation of the U.S. federal government and red, white, and blue. I also grouped the 3 categories of state spending in orange to be consistent with Tennessee's color assocation. I used red in my sketch for "State Funding Used into of Federal" to call attention to it - like a red flag.

## Feedback on Sketch
For feedback, I spoke to:
Adult, early 60s
Student, mid 20s

Both people I interviewed suggested using shades of blue and orange to make the distinction between to the different categories within groups more clear. They also both agreed that "State Funding Used Instead of Federal" should be organge not red as the addition of the extra color made it intially unclear it was about state spending. Additionally, one person suggested using a bar chart because the horizontal orientation would make changes in the individual categories easier to compare over time. 

## First Visualization:
I used this feedback to swtich the data visualization type to a bar chart. I felt this was especially benefical in making comparisons since the categories were stacked instead of spread out across the visualizaiton like in the column chart.

## Final Visualization
During the group critique in-class, my two classmates agreed on the critique that the visualization did not have to include every column from the table to tell the main story. For the final verison, I removed the "Federal Award" column and "Federal Expenditure" column because it doesn't contribute to the overall narrative in a way that I felt necessary. Alone, the "Federal Surplus/Deficit" data gives the viewer the information to see Tennessee's trend in having a surplus of federal funding. I also removed the columns "State MOE" and "State Expenditure". Simiarly, I felt this information was relayed enough in the "State Expenditures Above MOE" data as that shows the specific trend of Tennessee spending additional state funds. By removing those four columns, the visualizatoin is simplified to the main components needed to understand the narrative. 
Lastly, I added a more descriptive title to this verison to make the visualization more intuitive.
