# Final Project Part 3
## The Audience
Originally, my target audience was limited to people living in America who have children or are concerned with childhood food insecurity. Overall, the goal was to target people who want to be advocates for the SFSP. I narrowed in on this goal and included information for organizations that are eligible and interested in becoming a program operator. I decided to add the information for organizations based on feedback from a fellow Youth Ambassador from my experience working with the SFSP. She felt that while the information was applicable to my intended audience, I was missing an opportunity to target organizations that can make an even bigger difference by administering the program. 
Additionally, based on feedback from interviews, my professor, and the class TA, I centered my narrative around the story that stood out to me from when I was working with the program. This helped to engage my audience because the information applied to everyone I was targeting.
I tried to make my call to action applicable to my target audience by providing a variety of ways to engage, either directly or in-directly. For example, I included a link to find free meals on No Kid Hungry's website for people who may have children or know a child experiencing food insecurity.

## Summary
The narrative aspect of my data story has evolved significantly from part 1 to part 3. Initially, I knew I wanted to discuss how the  SFSP fills in the gap of the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program for food insecure children. However, I originally didn't know how to turnt that into a narrative. After recieving feedback, I centered my narrative on a personal anecdote. This story illustrated the problem with program implementation. However, since my time with the SFSP, regulations have changed, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In my research, I realized how significant a role the COVID-19 pandemic made in increasing participation and costs of the SFSP. This connected well to make anecdote as well as the set-up about how food insecure children rely on the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program for reliable meals. Together this elements set the stage for the conlfict of my story.

For design, I used the same shade of red for my data visualizations about the number of free meals served in the SFSP and 
the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program. I used red to stand out and kept the color consistent as the goal was to display the need based on number of meals served through these federal programs. I used blue for the data visualization about costs of the SFSP and number of sites. I used blue to group these two data visualizations as a part of the problem.
