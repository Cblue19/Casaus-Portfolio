# Casaus-Portfolio
A collection of data visualizations from Telling Stories with Data

## About Me
Hi, I'm Bri Casaus (she/her). I'm a second year student in the MSPPM flagship program at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College.

## What I Hope to Learn
I took the course to learn the skills needed to improve my data visualizations. My internship relies heavily on creating data visualizations, and I hope to apply what I learn in this course to make my data visualizations more intuitive. Additionally, I hope to learn how to have a clear narrative with my data visualizations. My main policy interests are poverty reduction, economic development, housing, and social programs. After I graduate, I hope to apply the skills I have learned in this course in one of those policy areas as a policy analyst.
