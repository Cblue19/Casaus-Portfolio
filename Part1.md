# Final Project: Part 1
For my final project, I want to tell a story about childhood food insecurity in the U.S. and how current federal child nutrition help mitigate this pervasive problem.

## Outline


## Initial Sketches 

## The Data
  ### Data for federal child nutrition programs: Click [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/child-nutrition-tables)
  This data is from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food and Nutrition Service. It contains information on annual and monthly national school lunches and breakfasts. Additionally, they provide data on the summer food service program. Additionally, they provide state level data on the same programs.
  ### Data on food security: Click [here](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-food-security.html#cpssupps)
  This data is from the U.S. Census Bureau and contains data from a survey designed to assess level of household security at the national level. 

## Method and Medium
  For my final project, I plan to utilize Shorthand.
