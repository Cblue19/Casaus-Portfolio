# Final Project: Part 1
## Outline
For my final project, I want to tell a story that highlights why childhood food insecurity is a problem in the U.S. and how current federally funded child nutrition programs help mitigate this pervasive problem by directly providing children with meals.
I plan to open my presentation with an overview of what food insecurity is and how being food insecure impacts a person's congitive ability and potential life outcomes. This portion of the presentation will set the stage of why the audience might be concerned with this issue. Next, I plan to move into data visualizations about child food insecurity rates to show the degree to which this is a problem. Then, I plan to provide an overview of federally funded child nutrition programs that directly provide meals to children followed by a series of data visualizations highlighting how impactful these programs are. Lastly, I plan to dive into the nutritional value of meals provided by federally funded child nutrition programs and why this element is espeically important for childhood development. I plan to close my presentation with a call to action on how the audneicne can get involved in supporting these programs.

## Initial Sketches 

In the section about the amount of meals provided by federally funded childhood nutrition programs, I plan to utilize a bar chart to highlight how many meals are provided annually through each porgram. Additionally, I plan to use a map per program with a blue gradient to highlight which states provided the most meals. 

The map will look similar to this with pop-up boxes that provide a count of meals served. The title of the map will highlight which states or regions have the highest amount of meals served.

## The Data
  ### Data on federal child nutrition programs: Click [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/child-nutrition-tables)
  This data is from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food and Nutrition Service. It contains information on annual and monthly national school    lunches and breakfasts. Additionally, they provide data on the summer food service program. Additionally, they provide state level data on the same programs. I plan to use this data to show how many meals are provided to children through federally funded child nutrition programs.
  ### Data on child nutrition: Click [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/child-nutrition-database)
  This data is also from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food and Nutrition Service. This has information about the nutritional quality of child nutrition programs. 
  ### Data on food security: Click [here](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-food-security.html#cpssupps)
  This data is from the U.S. Census Bureau and contains data from a survey designed to assess level of household security at the national level. I plan to use this data to highlight the degree in which food insecurity is experienced among children.

## Method and Medium
  For my final project, I plan to utilize Shorthand. Similar to the demo presented in class, I plan to use pictures during the sections in which I want to provide context and describe the issue of childhood food insecurity or federally funded child nutrition programs. Data visualizations will be used in between the content sections to reinforce the ideas introduced in the content sections.
