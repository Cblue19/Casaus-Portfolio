# Final Project Part II

## Set Up
I want to open my presentation with an overview of food insecurity among children in the United States. I plan to have an image with the statistic that 9 million children are food insecure in the U.S. This will be followed by a defintion of food insecurity as well as the different degrees of food insecurity the USDA defines. I then plan to talk about how the federally funded national school breakfast and lunch program provides two guaranteed meals for students that attend public schools during the academic year. This program is utilized at high rates across the entire country. The following visualizaitons will be used:

However, the breakfast and lunch program only provide reliable meals when school is in session. That means during the summer many food insecure children no longer have two reliable meals. This is where the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) fills in the gap.

## Conflict
Like many other federally funded program, the Summer Food Service Program has a number of requirements that must be met to continue recieving funding. I became familar with a number of the requirements for the program in 2019 when I worked as a feeding site monitor for the SFSP. During a meeting in D.C. with other people working in the SFSP, I heard a person working in Las Vegas tell a story about watching kids try to drink milk on a bus without A.C. in 110 degree desert heat. In order to recieve funding, children are required to consume a portion of their meal on site in order for the meal to be federally reimbursed. The story the worker shared illustrated how this requirement has a negative impact on kids particpaing in the program. While changes have been made to the requirements since 2018, different requirements have been added in response to the COVID-19 pandmeic.
