# Final Project Part II

## Wireframes and Storyboards
### Set Up
I want to open my presentation with an overview of food insecurity among children in the United States. I plan to have an image with the statistic that 9 million children are food insecure in the U.S. This will be followed by a defintion of food insecurity as well as the different degrees of food insecurity the USDA defines. I then plan to talk about how the federally funded national school breakfast and lunch program provides two guaranteed meals for students that attend public schools during the academic year. This program is utilized at high rates across the entire country. The following visualizaitons will be used:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/11351091"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11351175"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11350945"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

However, the breakfast and lunch program only provide reliable meals when school is in session. That means during the summer many food insecure children no longer have two reliable meals. This is where the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) fills in the gap.

### Conflict
Like many other federally funded program, the Summer Food Service Program has a number of requirements that must be met to continue recieving funding. I became familar with a number of the requirements for the program in 2019 when I worked as a feeding site monitor for the SFSP. During a meeting in D.C. with other people working in the SFSP, I heard a person working in Las Vegas tell a story about watching kids try to drink milk on a bus without A.C. in 110 degree desert heat. In order to recieve funding, children are required to consume a portion of their meal on site in order for the meal to be federally reimbursed. The story the worker shared illustrated how this requirement has a negative impact on kids particpaing in the program. While changes have been made to the requirements since 2018, different requirements have been added in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and others program needs have become more apparent. At this point I plan to discuss the current problems with the SFSP.

Then I plan to transition into a discussion about the other essential piece of the SFSP: funding. In order for the SFSP to meet the needs of children in the summer, the program must be adequately funded. Since participation increased significantly during COVID-19, the costs of the program have increased.

It is essential to address the needs of the SFSP and ensure it has adequate funding as the data shows many kids throughout the country depend on this program.

### Resolution
My call to action for my audience is to donate and support non-profits that lobby Congress for benefical changes and funding for the SFSP. At this point in the presentation, I'll provide information about a few different organizations, including No Kid Hungry, the organization I worked for through my local food bank. I plan to share a short story about how I got to lobby on Capitol Hill with No Kid Hungry.

## User Research and Interviews
a. My target audience is people who have kids or are concerned with the welfare of kids in America as well as people who want to be advocates for the SFSP.
b. I used my target audience to inform who I selected to interview by picking two parents and one person who has worked for the SFSP before/works in food security. 
Who I interviewed:
1. Adult, early 60s
2. Adult, late 50s
3. Student, mid 20s
c. Q1: After reading through my set-up, what do anticpate the conflict to be?
Q2: Do you find the set-up, conflict, and resolution to be connected well?
Q3: What is the main idea you gather from each data visualization?
Q4: Do you think each data visualization is relevant to include?
Q5: Is the resolution satisfying? 
d. Question one was met with promising responses, but I gathered that I should emphasis the role COVID-19 played in the increased need for the program in the set-up more. My audience agreed I could use more descriptive titles as they were originally just about the count instead of the trend. When I presented my storyboard, I included the hexagon maps featured above as well as a standard map with the same data. All three of the people I interviewed (as well as my classmates) agreed that the hexagon map displayed the data better because it allowed the audience to focus on the trend since the state sizes were uniform. My audience also gave me feedback about the color palette I used in my data visualizations for the the National Breakfast and Lunch Program as they felt the similarities of in color made the different types look related instead of emphasizing differences.
e. For the in-class critique, I updated my visualizations to reflect the feedback I gathered from my interviews. This included switching the map type, change the color palette used, and adding more descriptive titles. After the in-class critique, I updated my visuals to include a more defined color gradient, removed additional dots from my line graphs, and further edited my titles to be more descriptive. I also removed information about paid and reduced lunches in the visualization about the National Breakfast and Lunch Program to make the visualizations more clear.
