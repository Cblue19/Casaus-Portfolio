# Final Project Part II

## Set Up
I want to open my presentation with an overview of food insecurity among children in the United States. I plan to have an image with the statistic that 9 million children are food insecure in the U.S.
I then plan to talk about how the federally funded national school breakfast and lunch program provides two guaranteed meals for students that attend public schools during the academic year.
